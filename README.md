# Loan-repayment-schedule
amortization schedule, sinking fund schedule

The CMPT Assignment is a excel can helping with the sinking fund schedule. 
Three main type of calculation can be done by using that excel:
  1. The date that loan will be fully repay. 
  2. What minimum initial monthly deposit into the sinking fund is required in order to fully repay the mortgage by a given target date?  
  3. What is the highest renewal mortgage rate for which the homebuyer would still be able to fully repay the loan by the end of the  amortization period by making the same monthly payments and using the side fund to make annual lump sum prepayments? 
  
I also attached the instruction manual. :p
